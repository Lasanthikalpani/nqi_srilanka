        <section>
            <h2>Understanding Accreditation</h2>
            <p>Accreditation is the independent evaluation of conformity assessment bodies against recognized standards
                to carry out specific conformity assessment tasks. It provides formal recognition that a body is
                competent to perform specific tasks, such as testing, calibration, inspection, and certification.</p>
            <p>For businesses, particularly those engaged in international trade, accreditation offers confidence that
                their products or services meet quality and safety requirements, reducing the need for re-testing or
                re-certification in different markets. It enhances credibility and facilitates market access.</p>
