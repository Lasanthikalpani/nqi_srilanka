            <h2>Introduction to National Quality Infrastructure (NQI)</h2>
            <p>The National Quality Infrastructure (NQI) in Sri Lanka is a vital system comprising standardization,
                accreditation, and metrology, linking to Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) and regulatory frameworks.
                It is designed to enhance product quality, drive technological advancement, and support national
                economic development by establishing a robust conformity assessment regime.</p>
            <p>The NQI operates on a decentralized model involving key organizations such as the Sri Lanka Standards
                Institution (SLSI), the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department (MUSSD), and the Sri Lanka
                Accreditation Board for Conformity Assessment (SLAB). These pillars are interdependent, and their
                collective progress reflects the nation's technical and modern advancements.</p>
            <p>The regulatory framework plays an integral part, utilizing standards and technical regulations to ensure
                compliance in various sectors. Furthermore, Sri Lanka has developed a National Quality Infrastructure
                Strategy (NQIS), supported by the EU, Ministry of Development Strategies & International Trade (MODSIT),
                and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB). This strategy aims to guide quality-related functions
                towards strategic development, address existing challenges, and define concrete opportunities through a
                detailed plan of action. The NQIS outlines the hierarchy and responsibilities of key NQI entities.</p>
