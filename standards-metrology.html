        <h1>Standards and Metrology Services in Sri Lanka</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>The Role of Standards</h2>
            <p>Standards are fundamental to a robust Quality Infrastructure. They provide guidelines, specifications,
                and characteristics that products, services, or processes should meet to ensure quality, safety, and
                compatibility. In Sri Lanka, national standards are developed and promoted to facilitate trade, protect
                consumers, and enhance industrial efficiency.</p>
            <p>Adherence to standards helps businesses reduce costs, improve performance, and gain access to new
                markets. International standards, such as those from ISO and IEC, are particularly important for global
                trade and compatibility.</p>

                the Bureau of Ceylon Standards Act No. 38 of 1964 and subsequently re-designated by the Sri Lanka
                Standards Institution Act No. 6 of 1984.</p>

                <li>Formulation and publication of Sri Lanka Standards (SLS).</li>
                <li>Promotion of standardization and quality assurance activities.</li>
                <li>Operating product certification schemes (SLS Mark) and management system certification schemes.</li>
                <li>Providing testing and calibration services.</li>
                <li>Acting as the national enquiry point for TBT (Technical Barriers to Trade) and SPS (Sanitary and
                    Phytosanitary) measures.</li>
                <li>Conducting training and awareness programs on quality and standardization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Importance of Metrology</h2>
            <p>Metrology is the science of measurement and plays a critical role in ensuring accuracy and reliability in
                trade, industry, science, and daily life. Accurate measurements are essential for fair trade, product
                quality, health and safety, and scientific research.</p>
            <p>In Sri Lanka, the national metrology system ensures that measurements made in the country are traceable
                to international standards, providing confidence in results.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>National Metrology Institute: Measurement Units, Standards & Services Department (MUSSD)</h2>
