        <h1>Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) & Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Understanding TBT and SPS Agreements</h2>
            <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and
                Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures are crucial for international trade. These agreements aim to ensure that
                technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures (TBT) and measures to protect
                human, animal, or plant life or health (SPS) do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade.</p>
            <p>For Sri Lankan businesses, particularly SMEs involved in exports or imports, understanding and complying
                with these agreements is essential for gaining market access and ensuring product safety.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)</h2>
            <p>The TBT Agreement covers all technical regulations, voluntary standards, and conformity assessment
                procedures, except for SPS measures. Its main objective is to prevent product requirements from becoming
                unnecessary barriers to trade.</p>
            <h3>Key aspects for businesses:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standards:</strong> Compliance with national and international voluntary standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Regulations:</strong> Mandatory requirements that products must meet.</li>
                <li><strong>Conformity Assessment:</strong> Procedures like testing, inspection, and certification to
                    determine if product requirements are met.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The agreement encourages members to use international standards where appropriate and to ensure
                transparency in developing and implementing technical regulations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures</h2>
            <p>The SPS Agreement applies to all measures taken to protect human or animal health from food-borne risks,
                animal or plant-carried diseases, or to protect a country from pests or diseases. These measures include
                laws, decrees, regulations, and procedures, including product criteria, processing methods, and
                quarantine treatments.</p>
            <h3>Key aspects for businesses:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food Safety:</strong> Measures to ensure that food products are safe for consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Animal Health:</strong> Protection against diseases affecting animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Plant Health:</strong> Prevention of the spread of pests and diseases among plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Countries must notify other WTO members of new or changed SPS
                    measures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SPS measures must be based on scientific principles and should not be applied in a manner that
                constitutes a disguised restriction on international trade.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Role of Sri Lankan Institutions</h2>
            <p>Several institutions in Sri Lanka play a vital role in facilitating compliance with TBT and SPS measures,
                including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI):</strong> Responsible for national standards and
                    technical regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Sri Lanka Accreditation Board for Conformity Assessment (SLAB):</strong> Provides
                    accreditation for testing and certification bodies, ensuring their competence.</li>
                <li><strong>Department of Agriculture / National Plant Quarantine Service:</strong> Handles
                    phytosanitary measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Department of Animal Production and Health:</strong> Manages animal health-related SPS
                    measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Ministry of Health:</strong> Oversees food safety regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SMEs can seek guidance and support from these institutions to ensure their products meet the required TBT
                and SPS standards for local and international markets.</p>
